A collection of scripts to get statistics, generate plots, get predictions on the draws for EuroMillions.

You are reading the docs generated from the docstrings in my "loto" project. The source code can be viewed on Github here: https://github.com/baychimo/loto

Over there you'll find info on how to get started, install the environment and make your own predictions! Or simply fork the code and take it somewhere else!
Or you can keep on reading the docs here:
